# HP25-Bundle: Decentralized Microlending Platform

A revolutionary decentralized microlending platform that combines loan tokenization, intelligent bundling, and advanced risk assessment to create a secure and liquid marketplace for microloans.

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Vision & Overview

HP25-Bundle revolutionizes microlending by:
- Creating a decentralized marketplace for small loans
- Enabling loan tokenization and bundling for improved liquidity
- Providing sophisticated risk assessment and resource allocation
- Empowering borrowers in developing economies while offering investors new opportunities
- Maintaining securitization innovation while ensuring benefits flow to underserved communities

## Inspiration
Our project was inspired by the critical gap in microfinance: while millions of people need small loans for business and personal development, traditional financial systems often fail to serve them efficiently. We drew inspiration from:
- The success of platforms like Kiva in connecting lenders with borrowers

4. **Market Creation**: Provides a secure platform where:
   - Borrowers can access affordable loans
   - Investors can trade microloan-backed securities
   - Risk is distributed through intelligent bundling
   - Returns are optimized through AI-driven allocation

## Core Features

### For Borrowers
- Secure loan application submission
- Transparent risk assessment and interest rates
- Real-time application status tracking
- Flexible payment schedules

### For Investors
- Access to tokenized microloan bundles
- Diversified investment opportunities
- Real-time portfolio management
- Blockchain-based security trading

## Project Components

### 1. Loan Bundling System (`/loan_bundling`)
- Intelligent loan bundling algorithms
- Database operations and schema management
- Firebase integration for real-time data
- Resource allocation optimization
- Bundle risk calculation methods:
  - Weighted Average
  - Nonlinear Method
  - Variance-Adjusted Scoring

### 2. Risk Assessment Engine (`/RiskModelandAPI`)
#### Risk Scoring Parameters
- Essential Parameters (e.g., funded_amount, sector, location)
- Recommended Parameters (e.g., borrower demographics, payment history)
- Optional Parameters (e.g., geographical data, exchange rates)
- Bundle-specific Parameters (for aggregated risk assessment)

#### Risk Score System
The risk assessment model uses an advanced XGBoost regressor that outputs scores on a 0-100 scale:

##### Risk Score Interpretation
- 90-100: Excellent (Very Low Risk)
  - Historical pattern of full repayment
  - Strongest creditworthiness indicators
  - Ideal for bundling as anchor loans

- 75-89: Good (Low Risk)
  - Strong repayment probability
  - Favorable risk indicators
  - Reliable bundle components

- 60-74: Moderate (Average Risk)
  - Acceptable repayment probability
  - Some risk factors present
  - Suitable for diversified bundles

- 40-59: Caution (High Risk)
  - Elevated default probability
  - Multiple risk factors
  - Requires risk mitigation strategies

- 0-39: High Caution (Very High Risk)
